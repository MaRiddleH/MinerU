Findings of this kind are crucial for the development of more effective and efficient waste treatment technologies that can operate at optimal temperatures, thus minimizing the environmental impact of PFAS. The study provides a scientific basis for these operational improvements and also offers a benchmark for regulatory standards concerning the thermal treatment of PFAS. ",

The use of granular activated carbon significantly enhances the degradation efficiency, particularly at lower temperatures, by influencing the pathways and increasing the yield of fluorine. By integrating these findings into their operations, facilities can achieve higher degradation efficiencies, thereby reducing the long-term environmental footprint of PFAS disposal. ",

Our previous studies have shown that certain PFAS compounds can become volatile at moderate temperatures. Therefore, suboptimal incinerator operation may lead to the release of PFAS from the system. Sustainability and efficiency depend on addressing PIDs, potentially by implementing emission control systems to capture fugitive emissions, though such measures would require a thorough cost-benefit analysis and appropriate regulatory support.
