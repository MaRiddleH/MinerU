Findings of this kind are crucial for the development of more effective and efficient waste treatment technologies that can operate at optimal temperatures, thus minimizing the environmental impact of PFAS. The study provides a scientific basis for these operational improvements and also offers a benchmark for regulatory standards concerning the thermal treatment of PFAS."

We demonstrated that near-complete degradation \\((\\geq 99\\%)\\) of unsaturated perfluorocarbons (PFCs) like \\(\\mathrm{C_7F_{14}}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{C_8F_{16}}\\) is achievable at temperatures above \\(300^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\), forming organofluorine compounds as the dominant pathway, whereas saturated PFCs require temperatures exceeding \\(500^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\) for similar results. The use of granular activated carbon significantly enhances the degradation efficiency, particularly at lower temperatures, by influencing the pathways and increasing the yield of fluorine. By integrating these findings into their operations, facilities can achieve higher degradation efficiencies, thereby reducing the long-term environmental footprint of PFAS disposal."

However, it is important to note that existing incineration systems were not specifically designed to handle PFAS-containing waste. Our previous studies have shown that certain PFAS compounds can become volatile at moderate temperatures. Therefore, suboptimal incinerator operation may lead to the release of PFAS from the system. Sustainability and efficiency depend on addressing PIDs, potentially by implementing emission control systems to capture fugitive emissions, though such measures would require a thorough cost-benefit analysis and appropriate regulatory support."

Elevated levels (several tens of \\(\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{L}\\)) of PFAS have been found in groundwater at a number of locations in the United States. Groundwater contamination of PFAS is directly associated with surface soil contamination. The major contamination sources include fire-training sites using aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) and municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. Concentrations of PFOA/PFOS as high as 87,140 ng/L have been measured in landfill leachates. PFAS can move off-site from contamination sources (landfills, AFFF-applied sites, or biosolids) and migrate to aquifers via leaching and surface water via runoff. PFAS-laden MSW pose considerable challenges to established waste disposal and recycling practices."

The goal of thermal desorption, however, is simply to separate PFAS from soil, and subsequent treatment of vaporized PFAS molecules is still needed. Gerhard at the University of Western Ontario and Major at Geosyntec Consultants investigated thermal degradation of PFAS in soil by smoldering combustion.[32-33] Dastgheib et al. investigated PFAS degradation on spent resins by means of thermogravimetric analysis to simulate the incineration process.[34] Wang et al. suggested direct F elimination from PFCAs during thermal treatments.[35] Blotevogel et al. found that the primary decomposition mechanism of PFOA is C-COOH cleavage, whereas \\(\\alpha\\)-elimination predominates in the breakdown of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA).[36] Using density functional theory, Adi and Altarawneh explored various potential thermal decomposition pathways for HFPO-DA.[37] Kennedy and colleagues conducted a series of experiments via thermogravimetric analysis coupled with FTIR (TGA-FTIR) for the simultaneous and continuous real-time analysis of the volatile products of incomplete combustion (PIDs) of PFOA and PFOS (the acid form).[38-41] Hughey et al. employed sampling bags to capture gaseous PIDs of K-PFOS, which were"

We further found that perfluoroheptene thermally decomposed at temperatures as low as \\(200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\) to shorter-chain homologues following a radical chain-scission mechanism.[14] An afterburner temperature of \\(890^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\) appears to be effective to decompose fugitive PFAS and volatile degradation products.[14] The exhaust gas will be passed through a column filled with \\(\\mathrm{CaO}^{44}\\) or kaolinite[28] to remove HF generated from both tube furnaces."
